    Isaiah 1:2 KJV
    Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
    
    Acts 3:19-20 KJV
    Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; [20] And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:
    
    Colossians 2:19 KJV
    And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.
    
    Luke 14:16-17 KJV
    Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: [17] And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.
    
    Matthew 11:27 KJV
    All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.
    Matthew 11:28 KJV
    Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
    
    John 15:4-5 KJV
    Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. [5] I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
    
    Psalm 1:3 KJV
    And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
    
    Philippians 4:19 KJV
    But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
    
    Matthew 6:33 KJV
    But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
    
    Psalm 23:1-6 KJV
    The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. [2] He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. [3] He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. [4] Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. [5] Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. [6] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
    
    Romans 8:31-32 KJV
    What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? [32] He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
    
    1 Peter 2:2 KJV
    As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:
    *I will grown.
    
    John 15:3 KJV
    Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
    
    Daniel 1:5 KJV
    And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
    
    Ephesians 5:26-27 KJV
    That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, [27] That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
    *Nourishment from above.
    
    Luke 14:16-17 KJV
    Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: [17] And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.
    
    Jeremiah 32:27 KJV
    Behold, I am the Lord , the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?
    *What God cannot do did not exist.
    
    Isaiah 43:10-13 KJV
    Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord , and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. [11] I, even I, am the Lord ; and beside me there is no saviour. [12] I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord , that I am God. [13] Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?
    
    John 3:16-18 KJV
    For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. [17] For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. [18] He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
    
    Matthew 6:33 KJV
    But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
    
    Luke 15:31 KJV
    And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.
    
    1 Peter 5:7 KJV
    Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
    
    Luke 12:32 KJV
    Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
    
    Mark 8:1-3 KJV
    In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him , and saith unto them, [2] I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat: [3] And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.
    *
    
    Proverbs 10:22 KJV
    The blessing of the Lord , it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.
    
    Genesis 24:1 KJV
    And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.
    
    1 Corinthians 3:21 KJV
    Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
    
    Matthew 7:7-11 KJV
    Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: [8] For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. [9] Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? [10] Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? [11] If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
    
    John 14:13-14 KJV
    And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. [14] If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.

    We like to caution you on your latest antics to renew your grand 1804 design to conquer the entire country, not through ideas but through the most savage tradition of killings and maiming.<br />
    <br />
    This to us is at the bottom of the current Fulani kidnapping in Yorubaland. We wish to inform you that we are aware of your grand plan to renew a project done half way and put on mute mode since the defeat of your forces in 1840 by the Yoruba Army.<br />
    <br />
    We are worried that you and your Fulani people have been suspiciously silent on the kidnapping of Yoruba people, the killing of our young professionals including the killing of the daughter of a prominent Yoruba leader.<br />
    <br />
    We were not surprised that you and the other Fulani leaders did not consider it necessary to send condolence messages or even visit the family of the slain woman. This can only mean your tacit approval or at least, a philosophy of cold compromise.<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    Please be aware that in the past two years, records show that 689 Yoruba people have been kidnapped by your people, Fulani, about 400 reported cases of rape, including rape of toddlers. Out of this number of&nbsp; the kidnapped, 356 were women, and out of that number, 250 were married women.<br />
    <br />
    In all, 112 people were killed by your Fulani people either for resisting kidnap or for failing to pay ransom. This may mean nothing to you, but to us, it means a lot.<br />
    <br />
    We urge you to imagine a group of armed Yoruba cocoa farmers storming forests in Kano, Katsina and Sokoto, kidnapping Fulani people, raping their young girls and even killing the daughter of an Emir or a prominent Fulani leader? Can you also imagine the same heavily armed&nbsp; Yoruba cocoa farmers occupying your forests, stopping your people from farming and preventing your people from plying the highways in their ancestral homes?<br />
    <br />
    To make the matter worse, imagine the armed Yoruba cocoa farmers carry out these terrible crimes under the banner of a Yoruba man as the Nigerian President. How will you feel?<br />
    As it is, your people, the Fulani are digging their hands down our throats. They are entering our bedrooms and sleeping with our mothers and wives. These actions are not only against Islam, they are against humanity.<br />
    <br />
    These latest actions plus our experiences in the past have combined to renew the energy of millions of Yoruba people who want a country of their own. Either you like it or not, this will happen. God, before whom you and your big crown are like but a filthy rag, will make it happen.<br />
    <br />
    We urge you to prepare your self to dialogue or if you chose the path of violence, there will be proportional response.&nbsp; Having Yoruba or Igbo Republics&nbsp; is something you do not wish to hear, but which is imminent and inevitable.<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;Please be aware that the Yoruba do not begrudge your values and the ways of your living, all we are saying is that we want to live our lives, design our political and cultural architecture, live and die on our own terms.<br />
    <br />
    The forthcoming Yoruba Republic will be glad to accommodate righteous Fulani people who respect our civilisations and the laws of our fatherland.<br />
    <br />
    We wish to use this opportunity to advice you and your people to be aware that you have no power to conquer Yoruba Nation. Your forebears tried and failed. Your military and political surrogates tried, marked with killings, maiming and destruction of our economy, yet they failed.<br />
    <br />
    We ask you to instruct your people, the armed Fulani herdsmen to withdraw from Yoruba territories and on their own, mop up the cache of arms and ammunition stored in Yoruba territories.<br />

    Sir, the Yoruba people stand for peace and not war. We would prefer these issues to be resolved amicably without firing any gun shot. But, we wish to say that if your heart remains rebellious and your soul defiant, the Yoruba people are not afraid to confront you once again the way we did some 175 years ago, this time in the most ferocious manner you can ever imagine. It is necessary to let you know this even though we are aware that you will not change the conquest desires of your heart.<br />
    <br />
    We wish you a happy Salah and Allah’s wisdom to know and do what is right.<br />
