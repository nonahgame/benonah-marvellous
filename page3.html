    Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. [9] Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. [10] Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it . [11] And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. [12] And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.
    
    Proverbs 3:8-10 KJV
    It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. [9] Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: [10] So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
    
    Deuteronomy 28:1-3 KJV
    And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth: [2] And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God. [3] Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field.
    
    Psalm 89:33 KJV
    Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
    
    2 Chronicles 7:14 KJV
    If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
    
    Malachi 3:10-12 KJV
    Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it . [11] And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.

    We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.
    
    1 Corinthians 6:9-10 KJV
    Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

    With all due respect sir,&nbsp; we the Nigerian Army soldiers are not happy with you on how your fighting corruption focusing on only corrupt politicians and yahoo boys alone, forgeting about Nigerian Army which is the home of corruption in these&nbsp; nation. We want to tell you that your war against corruption is not ready yet if the Nigerian Army is not included!<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;Although i will not want anyone to go through stress trying to trace my identity, reason because of the fear of the unknown, (the power of corruption).<br />
    <br />
    Mr President Sir, we thank God for social media which is helping us in these modern days to expose some little secrets of the Nigeria Army, and&nbsp; we are ready to use it as a tool to speak against corruption in the Nigeria Army. I was enlisted into the Nigeria Army in 2002&nbsp; and ever since then, i have not being issued one single military&nbsp; kit or a per of uniform or&nbsp; boot, except the one issued to me when i was on&nbsp; training at Depot NA Zaria, Kaduna state, since then i can't remember any year i have being issued uniform, in all the years i have spent in the Army, which i can't tell you.&nbsp; (FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN).<br />

    Early these year i got a credit alert from my bank of&nbsp; #10,000 for uniform allowance,&nbsp; for how many years i joined the Army, i have never gotten any money to buy uniform or being issued uniform. when i got the alert i was happy although, but i asked myself how much is a per of uniform sold?&nbsp; Which i know already,&nbsp; but just confuse because to buy a per of camouflage cost 15,000&nbsp; to 16,000 naira in Nigerian Army Napex across the Nation, and a good boot cost about #17,000. It may intrest you to know that the uniforms being sold to us are actually main to be issued to us by the Army; they collect billions of naira from the government to produce these uniforms or kits clamming to issues them to&nbsp; soldiers serving the nation, and when it's being produced they are sold out to soldiers to buy and use these kits bought from they little salaries they are paid by the government, with all the responsibilities they are facing&nbsp; as theads of their families to buy kits to serve their country, no one want&nbsp; to talk about these, because the corrupt ones are powerful. The Army now is a business center where cadet on training in NDA are being train on how to cheat the soldiers under their command, when they leave NDA, they refers to soldiers as tools, to be used for making of&nbsp; money from they government. I will not say your not aware of these ethics of the Army,&nbsp; because your a retired General in the Army, and you know greed runs in the army which is not just starting now, that's why they keep telling us to obey they last order even when we are being cheated, we should keep quiet, they oppress us with their ranks, guards and positions, you know all these things and you never bothered to probe the Nigerian Army with your fight against corruption, when your security agencies are corrupt. I want to tell the army that the era where we find ourselves these days is not the same with the old and they should keep on expecting more of these letters to the government and Nigerians, because we are tired of being treated like slaves in these modern days, all in the name of serving your father land, we will not be quiet except there is changes in the army, we all are tired of the corruption in the army and we need things to change, we need these country to be the best in the world. I believe as a soldiers of these country i love Nigeria more than anyone else because i take bullets for her, i bleed for her, and i die for her, there is no greater sacrifice a citizen of any nation can do for his/her nation other than to carry arms and defend her and keep her safe, we are given the nation our best and so we deserved being given the best. Let the army know that you want to change the country and it most change because you want the best. I know you want the best for Nigerians don't forget us in the army because we are all Nigerians and we love our country.<br />

    Mr President i will like to take your attention to what is happening in the northeast (OP Lafiya Dole), where soldiers are being deployed in a very bad locations without beds to sleep on or tent to leave on,or any kit, leaving them to provide for themselves through the rotten zinc the villagers abandon and run. These are men who are fighting for these nation and yet they rebels are leaving better than them, no drugs no good vehicles and armarments to fight all because of how the system is corrupt&nbsp; and no one has ever remember fighting the corruption eaten up our defense, the only thing you can get from the army in northeast, is your 40% (30,000), allowance in your account and 20% (14,000) in your hands to buy any thing you need, while another&nbsp; 40%(30,000) for your monthly feeding, yet all they can&nbsp; give you is&nbsp; red oil rice and beans with bread every day for breakfast. Calculate these, in a battalion where they have 800 soldiers and the commander is being given 40%(30,000) of each soldier to provide food for them how many millions it will be? yet they can not feed the soldiers properly because of greed, and corruption, i be oga no one will ask me anything, and we are surfering in the army, and that is why they are sabotaging your effort to end terrorism in these nation, because they are benefiting and also enriching themselves from blood money, they don't have there nation intrest at heart. Mr President we had you on TV saying our northeast allowance is 150,000 naira, and all what we get is 74,000, all and all, we keep asking where the remaining balance is. Sir your war on corruption is not complete if these criminals in the army are not being probe for corruption but allowed to walk about protected by soldiers, protected by government.<br />
